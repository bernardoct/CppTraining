# C++ training for the Reed Group

This is the GitHub repository for the C++ training for the Reed Group. Please take a look at the [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11lC7m2Pk4_-8PTe1Ze_LO5Xr_EJM8nxu2OdtX5lrDmY/edit?pli=1) and the readings in it. The HW folders in this repository have both descriptions of the assignments and my answer codes, if you get stuck. Still, feel free to send me an e-mail or stop by my office with questions. I will mention in our meetings when to start working on an assignment.

## Schedule (will be updated after each meeting)
06/20, 10 a.m. to 11 a.m., HLS 166 - Basic C (read modules 1 and 2 and have CLion installed)
